# Blog template

Get the [source code here](https://github.com/flo-bit/blog-template)

Minimalistic but opinionated blog template using [astro](https://astro.build/) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev/). 
aims to be super easy to deploy and use, with a focus on performance and SEO, ease-of-use and design 
(see all [features here](/blog-template/posts/features)).

This blog doubles as a tutorial on how to use this template, start by [setting up your github repo](/blog-template/posts/how-to-use), 
then [add some content](/blog-template/posts/adding-content). For more information read about [supported markdown features here](/blog-template/posts/markdown-style-guide).
