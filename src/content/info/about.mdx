Hi! 👋

I'm William Oliveira, a Brazilian software engineer living in Spain.

With more than 10 years of experience I worked as technical lead and software engineer specialist (staff engineer) in several companies, from startups to large enterprises.

I love to spread knowledge and help other developers to grow in their careers. Because of this, I wrote three books about programming career in Brazil, all published by Casa do Código:

For beginners: [O Universo da Programação](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-universo-programacao)

For mid-levels: [Navegando no Universo da Programação](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-navegando-universo)

For experts: [Carreira Técnica no Universo da Programação](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-carreira-tecnica)

I'm a self-taught programmer, and I started my career as a web developer back in 2010. Since then, I have worked with several technologies, programming languages, and frameworks, but my main focus has always been on web development. In recent years, I have focused on AI Engineering and Machine Learning.

I'm a polyglot programmer. I enjoy using the right tool for the right job. Some of the programming languages I use daily are JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go. But I'm always open to learn new languages and technologies.

This blog is a dump of my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I write about software engineering, web development, and other things I find interesting.

Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-oliveira/) to learn more about frontend, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Web APIs, Software Architecture, Software Engineering, Git, GitHub, Open Source, Firebase, and more.
