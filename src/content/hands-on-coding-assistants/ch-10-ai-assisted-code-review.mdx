## AI-Assisted Code Review

TODO: Content for Chapter 10 — AI-Assisted Code Review (focus: Review)

**Topics to cover:**

- Copilot Code Review: how it works, how to request automatic review on PRs
- Customizing reviews with custom instructions (style, security checklist, standards)
- Automatic reviews — configuring Copilot to review every PR automatically
- "Implement suggestion" — invoking the coding agent to implement code review suggestions
- Limitations: Copilot never approves PRs (always "Comment"), reviews don't block merge
- Hands-on: set up automatic code review + security custom instructions for a repo
