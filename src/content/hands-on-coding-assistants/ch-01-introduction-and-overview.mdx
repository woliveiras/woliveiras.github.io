## Introduction & Overview

TODO: Content for Chapter 1 — Introduction & Overview

**Topics to cover:**

- Code assistants vs. code agents (completions → chat → agent mode → coding agent)
- Tool landscape: Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf — when to use each one
- Where AI delivers proven value (McKinsey data + GitHub Survey): tests, documentation, refactoring, debugging, boilerplate
- What AI does NOT do well: complex architectural decisions, organizational context, multifaceted requirements
