## Who this series is for

You already write software. You're comfortable with a code editor, a terminal, and version control. You've probably used GitHub Copilot's autocomplete or asked ChatGPT to explain an error message. This series picks up from there.

If you can clone a repo, install dependencies, and open a pull request — you have everything you need to follow along. If terms like "PR," "CI," or "environment variable" are unfamiliar, you'll want to learn the basics first.

## Required tools

Install these before starting Chapter 1. Every hands-on exercise in the series assumes they're available.

### 1. Visual Studio Code

VS Code is the primary editor throughout the series. As of version 1.99 (April 2025), GitHub Copilot is built in — no separate extension required.

- **Download**: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Minimum version**: 1.99+
- **Verify**: Open VS Code → `Help` → `About` → check the version number

### 2. Node.js

Most code examples use JavaScript or TypeScript. Node.js is also needed to run MCP servers and various CLI tools.

- **Download**: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (use the LTS version)
- **Minimum version**: 22+
- **Verify**:

```sh
node --version
# Expected: v22.x.x or higher
```

### 3. Git

You need Git for version control and to interact with GitHub repositories.

- **Download**: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) (or install via your OS package manager)
- **Minimum version**: 2.39+
- **Verify**:

```sh
git --version
# Expected: git version 2.39.x or higher
```

### 4. A package manager: npm or pnpm

`npm` ships with Node.js. Several chapters also use `pnpm` in examples — either works, but if you want to follow the examples exactly:

```sh
# npm is already installed with Node.js
npm --version

# To install pnpm (optional, but used in many examples)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm --version
```

### 5. GitHub account + Copilot access

You need a GitHub account with access to GitHub Copilot.

- **Create an account**: [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) (if you don't have one)
- **Copilot access**: The **Free tier** works for most exercises. **Copilot Pro** is recommended — it removes the monthly completion limits that might interrupt your workflow during longer exercises
- **Verify**: Open VS Code, click the Copilot icon in the status bar, and sign in with your GitHub account

## Recommended (not required)

These tools appear in specific chapters. You don't need them upfront — install them when the chapter calls for them.

| Tool | Used in | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Copilot CLI** | Ch 3, 5 | Command-line AI assistant (`gh copilot suggest`, `gh copilot explain`) |
| **Docker** | Ch 13, 14 | Running MCP servers and containerized environments |
| **jq** | Ch 14 | Parsing JSON in hook scripts |
| **Playwright** | Ch 9 | E2E test examples |
| **Python 3** | Ch 9 | Alternative test coverage examples (`pytest`) |

Each chapter that introduces an optional tool includes installation instructions in context.

## Knowledge this series assumes

The series teaches AI-assisted engineering workflows — not programming fundamentals. Here's what you should be comfortable with before starting:

### Must-have

- **Terminal basics** — navigating directories (`cd`), running commands, reading output. You don't need to be a shell expert, but you shouldn't be afraid of the command line.
- **JavaScript or TypeScript** — most code examples use TypeScript. You need to read and understand basic syntax: functions, types, async/await, imports. You don't need to be an expert — the AI will help.
- **Git fundamentals** — clone, commit, push, branch, merge. You should know what a pull request is and how to create one.
- **GitHub navigation** — creating repositories, opening issues, reviewing PRs on github.com.

### Helpful but not required

- **REST API concepts** — HTTP methods, status codes, JSON request/response. Chapters 4 and 17 use API examples extensively.
- **Testing concepts** — what unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests are. Chapter 9 explains the workflow but assumes you know the basic taxonomy.
- **CI/CD basics** — what GitHub Actions does and why you'd want automated pipelines. Chapters 6, 14, and 15 use workflows.
- **Another programming language** — some examples use Python, Go, or SQL to show that the workflows are language-agnostic. You don't need to know these languages — the principles transfer.

## Operating system

The series is OS-agnostic. Keyboard shortcuts are given for both macOS (`Cmd`) and Windows/Linux (`Ctrl`). Installation commands cover Homebrew (macOS), apt (Linux), and WinGet (Windows) where applicable. Hook scripts show both Bash and PowerShell variants.

If you're on **Windows**, you'll have the smoothest experience using **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for terminal commands, though it's not strictly required.

---

## Quick setup checklist

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```sh
# Check VS Code (run from terminal)
code --version
# Expected: 1.99.x or higher

# Check Node.js
node --version
# Expected: v22.x.x or higher

# Check Git
git --version
# Expected: git version 2.39.x or higher

# Check npm
npm --version
# Expected: 10.x.x or higher

# Check GitHub authentication (optional but helpful)
gh auth status
# Expected: Logged in to github.com
```

If all commands return valid versions, you're ready. Open Chapter 1 and let's get started.
