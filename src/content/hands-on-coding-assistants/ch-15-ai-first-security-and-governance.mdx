## AI-First Security & Governance

TODO: Content for Chapter 15 — AI-First Security & Governance (focus: Review + Correct)

**Topics to cover:**

- Risks: sensitive data exposure in prompts, code injection, malicious dependencies
- Agent firewalls — controlling domains/URLs the coding agent can access
- `excludeAgent` in instructions — separating what each agent can see
- Testing and releasing custom agents in organizations/enterprises
- AI-generated code and intellectual property: detecting code similar to public sources
- Hands-on: security audit of an agent setup + firewall configuration
