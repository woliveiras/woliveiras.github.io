## Agent Skills & Modular Expertise

TODO: Content for Chapter 8 — Agent Skills & Modular Expertise

**Topics to cover:**

- What are Agent Skills: `SKILL.md` + scripts in `.github/skills/`
- Difference between skills and custom instructions (skills are conditionally activated by the agent)
- Personal skills (`~/.copilot/skills/`) vs. project skills (`.github/skills/`)
- Hands-on: create a GitHub Actions debugging skill (using GitHub MCP tools)
