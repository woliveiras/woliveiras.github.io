## Test Generation & Improvement with AI

TODO: Content for Chapter 9 — Test Generation & Improvement with AI (focus: Review)

**Topics to cover:**

- Why test generation is the #1 productivity use case (98% adoption in GitHub Survey)
- AI-assisted TDD: write specs → generate tests → implement
- Generating unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Coverage gap analysis with agents
- Hands-on: take an untested module and use AI to create a full test suite with a coverage target
