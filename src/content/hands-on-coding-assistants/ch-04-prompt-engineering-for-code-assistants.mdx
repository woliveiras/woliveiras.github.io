## Prompt Engineering for Code Assistants

TODO: Content for Chapter 4 — Prompt Engineering for Code Assistants (focus: Plan)

**Topics to cover:**

- From basics to advanced: prompt structures, context, and precision
- Context management: open files, top-level comments, meaningful names, explicit imports
- Strategies for complex tasks: decomposition, iteration, examples
- When NOT to use AI — highly complex architectural tasks that require organizational context
- Hands-on: solve the same problem with different prompt strategies and compare results
