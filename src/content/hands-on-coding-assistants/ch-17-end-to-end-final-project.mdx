## End-to-End Final Project

TODO: Content for Chapter 17 — End-to-End Final Project (full PDRC)

**Topics to cover:**

- Complete challenge: receive issue → **Plan** (spec + acceptance criteria) → **Delegate** (custom agents + skills) → **Review** (tests + automatic code review) → **Correct** (iterate on feedback) → PR ready
- Multi-agent collaboration on a real codebase
- Retrospective: what worked, what didn't, where the developer had to intervene
- Discussion: how to bring this workflow into your team's daily routine
