## Debugging, Refactoring & Iteration with AI

TODO: Content for Chapter 11 — Debugging, Refactoring & Iteration with AI (focus: Correct)

**Topics to cover:**

- AI-assisted debugging: `/fix`, inline chat, error explanation
- Legacy code refactoring — time reduced by ~2/3 (McKinsey)
- Codebase onboarding — using AI to quickly understand unfamiliar projects
- **Iteration strategies (Correct):**
  - Effective re-prompting: adding context, providing examples of what's wrong
  - When to abandon the output: signs that the agent is stuck in a loop
  - Manual override: editing code directly instead of infinite re-prompting
  - Feedback loop for custom instructions
- Hands-on: take a legacy module, refactor it with an agent, iterate on errors, document corrections
