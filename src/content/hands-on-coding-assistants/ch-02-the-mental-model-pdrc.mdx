## The Mental Model: Plan, Delegate, Review, Correct (PDRC)

TODO: Content for Chapter 2 — The PDRC Mental Model

**Topics to cover:**

- **From PDCA to PDRC** — Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act is one of the most widely used continuous-improvement cycles in engineering. PDRC adapts it for a context where the "doer" is an AI agent:

| PDCA | PDRC | Why the change |
|------|------|----------------|
| Plan | **Plan** | Unchanged — define spec, scope, and acceptance criteria *before* touching any tool |
| Do | **Delegate** | You're no longer the one writing every line; you choose the right AI tool and scope the task for it |
| Check | **Review** | Same spirit, but now you're reviewing AI output — security, maintainability, readability, adherence to standards |
| Act | **Correct** | Emphasizes iterative correction of AI output — re-prompting, manual intervention, or knowing when to discard |

- The PDRC cycle as the operational framework for working with AI agents
- **Plan**: define spec, scope, acceptance criteria BEFORE triggering any agent — "if you can't describe what you want, the agent won't deliver it either"
- **Delegate**: choose the right tool for each task, scope the task to the right size
- **Review**: review EVERY output — security, maintainability, readability, adherence to standards
- **Correct**: iterate with context (re-prompting, feedback, manual intervention, knowing when to discard)
- Anti-pattern: "accept all" without reading — why this destroys productivity in the medium term
- Hands-on: comparison exercise — same problem solved with "prompt and accept" vs. full PDRC cycle
