## Impact Measurement & Continuous Improvement

TODO: Content for Chapter 16 — Impact Measurement & Continuous Improvement (focus: all 4 PDRC)

**Topics to cover:**

- Defining metrics: cycle time, PR lead time, test coverage, bug rate, developer satisfaction
- Developer experience — data shows devs with AI are 2x more likely to report "flow state" (McKinsey)
- Analyzing the performance of different agents
- Spec-driven development — documenting specs before coding to enforce "developer thinking first"
- Hands-on: measure before/after of a sprint using defined metrics
