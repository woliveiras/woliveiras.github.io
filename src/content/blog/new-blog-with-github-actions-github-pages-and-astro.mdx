I was thinking of creating a new blog to start writing in English. I need to practice my English skills, so, I think a blog is a nice way to do it, because I love to write. I already have a blog in Portuguese with a lot of blog posts, but I need to start this one to force me to practice this language. If you would like to check it out, it's this link: [woliveiras.com.br](https://woliveiras.com.br/).

It was very easy to create this new one. I just got a good template with the things I would like to use:

- the GitHub Pages
- the GitHub Actions

But I couldn't think that it would be so easy!

First of all, I used this simple template from Florian that I found on the Astro templates site: [github.com/flo-bit/blog-template](https://github.com/flo-bit/blog-template).

This template already has everything I was thinking of using. So I only clicked on `use template` on the GitHub interface and started writing my blog posts.

## The setup

I was looking for an Astro template because Astro is a nice framework based on React and already has a lot of good things for blogging. Like the syntax highlight, integration with a lot of JavaScript tools, MDX native integration, TypeScript by default and a great community.

To host my blog, I'm using GitHub Pages.

To build the static files, I'm using GitHub Actions.

To update the site settings and write this blog post, I'm using GitHub Codespaces. I used the smallest settings you can find [here](https://github.com/github/codespaces-host-images/blob/main/README.md).

Feel free to check the settings and what else you're curious about here: [github.com/woliveiras/woliveiras.github.io](https://github.com/woliveiras/woliveiras.github.io).
