you can show embeds in your blog posts for youtube, link cards and excalidraw diagrams.

### Youtube

simply write a youtube url in your post like this (with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

### Link Card

or any other url for a link card like this (again with nothing else on the same line):

```mdx
https://flo-bit.dev
```

### Excalidraw

you can also show excalidraw diagrams, that will be rendered in the correct dark/light mode like this:

```mdx
:excalidraw[/src/assets/excalidraw-demo.svg]
```
