Sometimes we need to schedule some task in our CI/CD pipelines. This job is not hard in GitHub Actions. We have an event named `schedule` to use in these cases and we can use the cron expressions to reach this goal with no difficult.

You can use my web app to easily create your cron expression: [woliveiras.github.io/cronor](https://woliveiras.github.io/cronor/).

Schedule example:

```yml ins={3}
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 12 1 *" // At 12:00 AM, on day 12 of the month, only in January
```

**OBS:** The **\*** is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string.

We can also trigger one workflow with multiple schedules.

Example:

```yml ins={3,4}
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 12 1 *" // At 12:00 AM, on day 12 of the month, only in January
    - cron: "0 12 12 1 *" // At 12:00 PM, on day 12 of the month, only in January
```

And we can access the schedule data in the jobs with this syntax `github.event.schedule`.

Example:

```yml ins={11}
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 12 1 *"
    - cron: "0 12 12 1 *"

jobs:
  scheduled:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Do not deploy on Fidays!
        if: github.event.schedule != "0 0 * * 5"
        run: echo "You should not deploy on Fridays"
```

One important thing you can do with this schedule event is [enable the Dependabot checks to keep your dependencies updated](/posts/how-to-schedule-dependabot-to-keep-dependencies-updated/).
