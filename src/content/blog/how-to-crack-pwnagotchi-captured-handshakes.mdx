This tutorial will guide you through the process of extracting Wi-Fi handshakes captured by your Pwnagotchi device and then attempting to crack them using Hashcat with a wordlist. Remember, this process is for educational purposes only, to understand Wi-Fi security, and should only be performed on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical.

## Requirements

- A Pwnagotchi device (fully configured and capturing handshakes).
- A computer with SSH client (like PuTTY on Windows, or built-in ssh in Linux/macOS).
- Hashcat installed on your computer.
- A wordlist (you can download one from https://weakpass.com/download – we'll use a common one for demonstration).
- `hcxdumptool` (often pre-installed on Kali Linux or easily installed on other Linux distributions).
- `hcxpcapngtool` (also often pre-installed or easily installed).

## Step 1: Recover the handshakes from your Pwnagotchi

The Pwnagotchi stores captured handshakes in a specific directory. We'll use Secure Copy Protocol (the `scp`) to transfer these files to your local machine.

### Connect to your Pwnagotchi

Ensure your Pwnagotchi is powered on and connected to your computer (either via USB tethering, Wi-Fi, or whatever method you've configured for SSH access).

You can check if the Pwnagotchi is working well using the ping or accessing it with SSH.

### Transfer the handshakes using SCP

First of all, open your terminal.

From your local computer's terminal, use `scp` to copy the handshake files. Replace `pi@pwnagotchi.local` with your Pwnagotchi's actual address and `/path/to/local/directory` with where you want to save the handshakes on your computer.

```sh
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/*.pcapng /path/to/local/directory/

# Or for .pcap files:
# scp pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/*.pcap /path/to/local/directory/
```

If you want, you can also copy the entire handshakes folder.

```sh
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/ /path/to/local/directory/
```

For example, to copy them to a handshakes folder in your *home* directory:

```sh
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/ ~/handshakes/
```

Enter your Pwnagotchi's password when prompted.

All examples:

```sh
# Copy .pcapng files:
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/*.pcapng /path/to/local/directory/

# Copy .pcap files:
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/*.pcap /path/to/local/directory/

# Copy the entire folder
scp -r pi@pwnagotchi.local:/home/pi/handshakes/ /path/to/local/directory/
```

## Step 2: Prepare handshake files for Hashcat

Hashcat requires the handshake files to be in a specific format (**HC22000** for WPA/WPA2). We can do it in our computer or use the website tool to convert.

I prefer to do it locally in my machine to run a command to convert all my files at once. We'll use `hcxpcapngtool` to convert the `.pcapng` files (or `.pcap` files, though `.pcapng` is more common for Pwnagotchi).

If you want to use the website, you can access this link: [hashcat.net/cap2hashcat](https://hashcat.net/cap2hashcat).

### Navigate to the Handshake Directory

Open a terminal on your local machine and navigate to the directory where you saved the handshakes:

```sh
cd /path/to/local/directory/handshakes/
```

If you're using the home folder for the handshakes, just run it:

```sh
cd ~/handshakes/
```

### Convert to Hashcat Format

If your using MacOS, you can install `hcxpcapngtool` using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install hcxtools
```

Use hcxpcapngtool to convert the .pcap files into a hash format that Hashcat can understand.

```sh
hcxpcapngtool -o output.hc22000 *.pcap
```

This command takes all .pcap files in the current directory and merges their crackable handshakes into a single file named **output.hc22000**.

## Step 3: Obtain a Wordlist
A wordlist is a file containing a list of potential passwords. The stronger your wordlist, the higher your chances of cracking a weak password.
Go to [weakpass.com/download](https://weakpass.com/download). You'll see several options for downloading wordlists. Be aware that these files are extremely large (tens of gigabytes) and will require significant disk space and download time. These are professional-grade lists.

- For a comprehensive, large wordlist, consider `weakpass_4.txt` or `weakpass_4a.txt`.
- If you're looking for lists specifically tailored to Latin-based character sets, `weakpass_4.latin.txt` or `weakpass_4a.latin.txt` might be suitable.
- `weakpass_4.merged.txt` is likely a combination of other lists.

## Step 4: Crack the handshakes with Hashcat

Now, we'll use Hashcat to attempt to crack the captured handshakes using your wordlist.

### Running Hashcat

Navigate to the directory containing your **output.hc22000** file and your wordlist.

Run the Hashcat commands. The basic command for WPA/WPA2 cracking with Hashcat is:

```sh
hashcat -m 22000 -a 0 output.hc22000 /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
```

Let's break down the command:

- `-m 22000`: Specifies the hash mode for WPA-EAPOL-PBKDF2 (Pwnagotchi captures these, and they are typically WPA/WPA2 handshakes).
- `-a 0`: Specifies the attack mode. **0** means "Direct Attack" (brute-force using a wordlist).
- `output.hc22000`: The input hash file generated by hcxpcapngtool.
- `/path/to/your/wordlist.txt`: The path to the wordlist you downloaded.

Example:

```sh
hashcat -m 22000 -a 0 output.hc22000 weakpass_4.txt
```

The output will show you the progress of the cracking attempt. If a password is found, it will be displayed in the terminal.

Example output:

```sh
> handshakes hashcat -m 22000 -a 0 output.hc22000 weakpass_4.txt

```

### Monitor the cracking process

Hashcat will start processing the wordlist against the handshakes. This can take a significant amount of time, depending on your computer's processing power (CPU/GPU) and the size of your wordlist.

If a password is found in your wordlist that matches a handshake, Hashcat will output the cracked password. You can also press `s` while Hashcat is running to see its status.

### View cracked passwords

Once Hashcat finishes (or if you stop it with `q`), any successfully cracked passwords will be saved to a file named `hashcat.potfile` in your Hashcat directory. You can view this file to see the results.

```sh
cat ~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile
```

## Understanding the results and next steps

If you successfully crack a handshake, it means that the Wi-Fi network's password was present in your wordlist. This highlights the importance of using strong, unique passwords for Wi-Fi networks.
- For Educational Purposes: This exercise demonstrates how common or weak passwords can be vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
- Improving Security: Encourage the use of long, complex passwords that are not easily guessable and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Beyond Wordlists: For more advanced scenarios, Hashcat supports other attack modes like brute-force (trying every possible combination), but these are significantly more resource-intensive.
Remember to always use these skills responsibly and ethically. Understanding these vulnerabilities helps in building more secure systems.
