The AI Agents are really useful for automating tasks. We can use them to generate text, analyze data, and even write code. However, their true potential is unlocked when multiple agents collaborate within a structured system.

I think that it was previsible, because we do something similar with microservices, where each service has a specific role and they communicate to achieve a common goal. A microservice alone can do a lot, but a well-orchestrated set of microservices can handle complex workflows efficiently.

And also because of the complexity of real-world tasks. A single agent might struggle to manage all aspects of a task, but a team of specialized agents can divide the workload, verify each other's outputs, and adapt to changing requirements.

This shift—driven by advances in reasoning, tool integration, and memory architectures—has created a new engineering discipline: **multi-agent system design**.

This article provides a deep, systematic exploration of modern multi-agent architectures, coordination protocols, orchestration patterns, memory strategies, and scaling techniques. While the fundamental ideas are inspired by classical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), the design principles have been adapted to the realities of LLM-driven autonomy.

## Multi-Agent Systems Older Than You Think

While studying multi-agent systems, we usually think that it's a recent concept born with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, the idea of multiple autonomous entities working together has been around for decades in computer science.

The concept of MAS is an established field in computer science and artificial intelligence, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Early research focused on distributed problem-solving, cooperative robotics, and agent communication languages like KQML and FIPA-ACL.

Victor Lesser, a pioneer in the field, is talking about multi-agent systems since the 1980s. Rodney Brooks also contributed significantly with his work on distributed robotics and the subsumption architecture. We also have some notable books like ["Multi-agent systems: An introduction to distributed artificial intelligence"](https://amzn.to/4pwS2Od) by Jacques Ferber (1999). So, while LLMs have revitalized interest in MAS, the foundational concepts have a rich history that an prove useful for modern implementations.

For understanding the base of MAS, we can learn the classical definitions and architectures, and then see how they adapt to the capabilities and challenges of LLM-based agents.

To understand it better, we'll learn the classical definitions. But, first, we need to understand what exaclty is an agent.

### What is an Agent?

An agent is an **autonomous entity** that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment using actuators to achieve specific goals. The agent has the following characteristics:

- **Autonomy**: Operates without direct human intervention.
- **Perception**: Senses its environment.
- **Reactivity**: Responds to changes in the environment.
- **Pro-activeness**: Takes initiative to achieve goals.
- **Objective-oriented**: Works towards specific objectives.
- **Social ability**: Interacts with other agents.

In the case of classical agents, they were often based on rule-based systems, symbolic reasoning, and deterministic planning. They lacked the generative capabilities of modern LLMs but were designed to perform specific tasks autonomously.

Now we can understand better what is a multi-agent system.

### What is a Multi-Agent System?

A MAS is composed of **multiple autonomous agents** that interact with each other to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to handle alone.

These agents can take various forms depending on the context:

- **Software Agents**: Programs that operate in digital environments, such as bots for financial trading, virtual assistants, or web crawlers.
- **Hardware Agents**: Physical devices equipped with sensors and actuators, like IoT devices or drones.
- **Robots**: Autonomous machines capable of performing physical tasks, such as assembly line robots or exploration rovers.
- **Distributed Systems**: Complex systems composed of multiple interconnected components, such as air traffic control systems or smart grids.

Each agent is designed to operate autonomously, perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. In a MAS, these agents collaborate, communicate, or compete to solve problems that exceed the capabilities of any single agent.

### Differences Between Classical MAS and LLM-Based MAS

With the advent of LLMs, the nature of agents has evolved significantly. Now, the agents leverage advanced language models for reasoning, communication, and decision-making. So, the MAS based on LLMs differ from classical MAS in some key aspects:

| **Aspect**          | **Classical MAS**                  | **LLM-Based MAS**                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Reasoning**       | Rule-based and symbolic logic      | Language generation and learning |
| **Communication**   | Formal languages (e.g., FIPA-ACL) | Natural language + structured JSON |
| **Planning**        | Deterministic                     | Emergent behaviors               |
| **Tool Access**     | Limited                           | Broad integrations (web, APIs, databases) |

LLM-based agents require new patterns for governance, safety, and orchestration due to their generative nature and the complexity of their interactions.

## The Core Architectural Models

Before we dive into specific architectures, it's useful to visualize a generic multi-agent ecosystem.

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": { "fontSize": "18px" }}}%%
graph LR
  User[User / External System]
  Orchestrator[Supervisor / Orchestrator]
  Planner[Planner Agent]
  Worker1[Worker Agent A]
  Worker2[Worker Agent B]
  Memory[(Memory Bus)]
  Tools[Tools / APIs]

  User --> Orchestrator
  Orchestrator --> Planner
  Planner --> Worker1
  Planner --> Worker2
  Worker1 --> Memory
  Worker2 --> Memory
  Worker1 --> Tools
  Worker2 --> Tools
  Memory --> Orchestrator
  Tools --> Worker1
  Tools --> Worker2
```

### 3.1. Centralized Orchestration

A **Supervisor** coordinates all interactions.
This is the simplest way to maintain control, consistency, and safety.

Pros: strong governance, easier debugging.
Cons: single point of failure, limited scalability.

### 3.2. Decentralized Architecture

Agents communicate peer-to-peer, negotiating tasks or sharing information.

Pros: scalable, robust.
Cons: harder to control, emergent drift more likely.

### 3.3. Hybrid Architecture

Hybrid architectures combine centralized planning with decentralized execution, often providing the best trade-off between control and scalability.

The diagram below contrasts centralized, decentralized, and hybrid approaches:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": { "fontSize": "16px" }}}%%
graph TD
  subgraph Centralized
    CUser[User]
    CSuper[Central Supervisor]
    CAgent1[Agent 1]
    CAgent2[Agent 2]
    CUser --> CSuper
    CSuper --> CAgent1
    CSuper --> CAgent2
    CAgent1 --> CSuper
    CAgent2 --> CSuper
  end

  subgraph Decentralized
    DUser[User]
    DAgent1[Agent 1]
    DAgent2[Agent 2]
    DAgent3[Agent 3]
    DUser --> DAgent1
    DAgent1 --> DAgent2
    DAgent2 --> DAgent3
    DAgent3 --> DAgent1
  end

  subgraph Hybrid
    HUser[User]
    HSuper[Supervisor]
    HPlanner[Planner]
    HWorker1[Worker 1]
    HWorker2[Worker 2]
    HUser --> HSuper
    HSuper --> HPlanner
    HPlanner --> HWorker1
    HPlanner --> HWorker2
    HWorker1 --> HSuper
    HWorker2 --> HSuper
  end
```

### 3.4. Memory Architecture

Memory determines how agents access context:

- **Local memory**: each agent keeps private state.
- **Shared memory**: vector store, graph memory, scratchpad, blackboard.
- **Generated memory**: LLM summarizes state over time.

Good memory design is essential for stability and cost management.

## 4. Communication and Coordination Protocols

### 4.1. Direct Messaging

Agents communicate through structured messages:

```json
{
  "sender": "planner",
  "receiver": "coder",
  "task": "implement function",
  "context": { ... }
}
```

### 4.2. Blackboard Model

Agents read and write to a shared knowledge base.
Useful for production workflows and DAG-style processing.

### 4.3. Auction and Bidding

Agents score themselves for capability and compete for tasks.
Inspired by contract-net protocols.

### 4.4. Delegated Planning Protocols

A planner decomposes tasks, assigns subtasks, and reconciles results.
This is currently the most robust pattern for multi-step reasoning.

### 4.5. Negotiation and Consensus

Agents cross-check outputs:

* majority voting
* chain-of-thought consensus
* critic-validation loops

This significantly reduces hallucination.

---

## 5. Orchestration Patterns

### 5.1. Supervisor–Worker

The Supervisor assigns tasks, workers execute them.
Ideal for workflows like document processing.

### 5.2. Role-Based Collaboration

Each agent has a persistent identity (Researcher, Editor, Critic).
Long-lived sessions improve coherence.

### 5.3. Tool Router Pattern

A router determines which agent or tool should handle a request.
Useful for systems with many plugins or integrations.

### 5.4. Planner–Executor Pattern

In the planner–executor pattern, one agent is responsible for decomposing the problem and another for executing the concrete steps.

The sequence diagram below shows how a planner, worker, and validator collaborate:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": { "fontSize": "16px" }}}%%
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant S as Supervisor
  participant P as Planner
  participant W as Worker
  participant V as Validator

  U->>S: Submit high-level request
  S->>P: Forward problem + constraints
  P->>P: Decompose into steps
  P->>S: Return execution plan
  S->>W: Assign step 1
  W->>W: Call tools / retrieve data
  W-->>S: Partial result
  S->>V: Request validation
  V->>V: Check correctness, policy, consistency
  V-->>S: Feedback (approve / request changes)
  S->>W: Apply feedback / continue with next steps
  S-->>U: Final answer + trace
```

### 5.5. Critic–Validator Pattern

A Validator reviews outputs from another agent and proposes corrections.

### 5.6. Self-Correcting Loop

Agents monitor each other for failures:

* timeout detection
* infinite loop detection
* hallucination mitigation

## 6. Implementing Multi-Agent Systems in Practice

### 6.1. Framework Comparison

* **LangGraph**: graph-based agent orchestration, deterministic execution.
* **AutoGen**: chat-based agent collaboration.
* **CrewAI**: role-based workflows.
* **Custom orchestrators**: maximum flexibility, but more engineering effort.

### 6.2. Designing Message Schemas

Define schemas for:

* tasks
* errors
* memory updates
* state transitions

Schemas improve traceability and enable migration to message buses.

### 6.3. Handling State and Memory

Memory strategies:

* sliding window context
* retrieval-augmented memory
* hierarchical memory (short-term + long-term)

### 6.4. Tooling Layer

A critical layer for:

* code execution
* web access
* SQL queries
* automation pipelines
* API integrations

Tools expand the operational capacity of the agents.

## 7. Observability, Debugging, and Governance

Execution traces in multi-agent systems can be represented as DAGs, where each node is an agent action or tool call and edges represent dependencies:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": { "fontSize": "16px" }}}%%
graph TD
  Start[User Request] --> P1[Planner: Decompose Task]
  P1 --> W1[Worker A: Fetch Data]
  P1 --> W2[Worker B: Transform Data]
  W1 --> W3[Worker C: Aggregate Results]
  W2 --> W3
  W3 --> V1[Validator: Check Consistency]
  V1 --> End[Supervisor: Return Final Answer]
```

Observability is essential in MAS:

* **Event logs**
* **Conversation graphs**
* **Execution DAGs**
* **Metrics** (latency, accuracy, cooperation quality)
* **Decision traceability**

Governance includes:

* guardrails
* rate limits
* tool whitelisting
* audit logs
* automatic fallbacks

---

## 8. Scaling Multi-Agent Systems

Scaling requires moving beyond in-memory orchestrators.

Strategies include:

* distributing agents across nodes
* adopting message queues (Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ)
* horizontal scaling via stateless agents
* caching and memory compression
* cost controls (adaptive liveness, dynamic workers)

Scalability transforms a prototype into a production-ready platform.

## 9. Reference Architecture (Blueprint)

A robust multi-agent system typically includes a supervisor, a planner, specialized workers, a shared memory bus, a tool layer, a message bus, and an observability stack.

The diagram below shows a high-level reference architecture:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": { "fontSize": "16px" }}}%%
graph TD
  User[User / Client]
  API[API Gateway]
  Supervisor[Supervisor / Orchestrator]
  Planner[Planner Agent]

  subgraph Workers
    WorkerA[Worker A]
    WorkerB[Worker B]
    WorkerC[Worker C]
  end

  Memory[(Memory Bus Vector DB / Graph DB)]
  Tools[Tool Layer APIs, DBs, Code Exec]
  Bus["Message Bus (Kafka / NATS / RabbitMQ)"]
  Obs[Observability Logs, Traces, Metrics]

  User --> API --> Supervisor
  Supervisor --> Planner
  Supervisor --> Bus
  Planner --> Bus
  Bus --> WorkerA
  Bus --> WorkerB
  Bus --> WorkerC
  WorkerA --> Tools
  WorkerB --> Tools
  WorkerC --> Tools
  WorkerA --> Memory
  WorkerB --> Memory
  WorkerC --> Memory
  Supervisor --> Memory
  Bus --> Obs
  Supervisor --> Obs
  WorkerA --> Obs
  WorkerB --> Obs
  WorkerC --> Obs
```

This blueprint is adaptable for enterprise, research, or automation contexts.
