## Introduction

This article is a simple tutorial on how to build an AI agent that can read PDF files stored in a local directory and answer questions about their content. The agent will use LangChain for orchestration and Ollama for running local LLMs and embeddings.

We'll walk through the entire process, from loading PDF documents, embeddings generation, RAG and retrieval to generating answers using a local language model.

We'll use the following technologies:

- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with LLMs.
- **Ollama**: A platform for running local LLMs and embeddings.
- **Gemma**: the LLM we'll use for generating answers.
- **Nomic Embeddings**: A model for generating text embeddings.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.

Let's get started!

## The Agent

The core idea behind this agent is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. This involves several key steps:

1. Document Loading: Loading the content from multiple PDF files.
1. Text Splitting: Breaking down the large text content into smaller, manageable chunks.
1. Embedding Generation: Converting these text chunks into numerical vector representations (embeddings).
1. Vector Store Creation: Storing these embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search.
1. Retrieval: When a query comes in, it retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the vector store.
1. Generation: Passing the retrieved chunks and the user query to an LLM to generate an informed answer.
   By orchestrating these steps, our agent can "understand" the context of the PDFs and provide accurate answers.

If you don't know what RAG is, I recommend reading my article on [RAG - Understanding the RAG Pattern with LLMs](/posts/understanding-rag-llm/).

## Architecture Overview

The agent's architecture can be visualized as follows:

- **PDF Loader**: Utilizes a Python library to read PDF documents.
- **Text Splitter**: Chunks the extracted text to fit within the LLM's context window.
- **Embedding Model**: A local embedding model converts text to vectors.
- **Vector Store**: A local vector database stores the embeddings.
- **Retriever**: Queries the vector store to find relevant document chunks.
- **Local LLM (Ollama)**: A locally hosted language model processes the retrieved context and user query to formulate an answer.
- **LangChain**: Acts as the orchestration layer, connecting all these components and defining the flow of information.

## Requirements

To run the code examples provided, you will need the following technical prerequisites:

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ollama is installed and running](https://ollama.com/docs/installation)

By leveraging Ollama, you can build and test these powerful patterns privately and cost-effectively on your hardware.

I use Visual Studio Code to type code, and its installed extensions already satisfy the needs for working with Python.

If you don’t know how to run the code examples, we have a session for doing it after the code.

## The AI Agent for PDF Question Answering with LangChain and Ollama Code

```python
import os
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFDirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_ollama import OllamaEmbeddings, OllamaLLM
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

# 1. Configuration
DATA_PATH = "data/" # Directory where your PDF files are located
VECTOR_DB_PATH = "./chroma_db" # Directory to store the vector database
LLM_MODEL = "gemma3:4b" # Local LLM model for generating answers
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "nomic-embed-text:latest" # Local embedding model for generating embeddings

# 2. Load Documents
def load_documents(data_path):
    loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(data_path)
    documents = loader.load()
    print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents.")
    return documents

# 3. Split Text
#
# chunk_size:
#   Defines the maximum size of each text chunk in characters.
#   Larger chunks can provide more context but must fit
#   within the LLM's context window.
# chunk_overlap:
#   Specifies the number of characters that overlap between
#   consecutive chunks. This helps maintain context across
#   chunk boundaries and prevents loss of information.
# add_start_index:
#   When True, a metadata field containing the starting index
#   of the chunk within the original document is added. Useful
#   for traceability and debugging.
def split_documents(documents):
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000,
        chunk_overlap=200,
        add_start_index=True
    )
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    print(f"Split documents into {len(chunks)} chunks.")
    return chunks

# 4. Create Embeddings and Vector Store
#
# documents:
#   The list of text chunks to be converted into embeddings.
# embedding_model:
#   The local embedding model used to convert text chunks into
#   numerical vector representations. This model should be
#   compatible with Ollama.
# vector_db_path:
#   The directory where the vector store will be persisted.
#   This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
#   The vector store can be queried later to find relevant chunks
#   based on user queries.
def create_vector_store(chunks, embedding_model, vector_db_path):
    print("Creating embeddings and vector store...")
    embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=embedding_model)
    vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(
        documents=chunks,
        embedding=embeddings,
        persist_directory=vector_db_path
    )
    print("Vector store created and persisted.")
    return vector_store

# 5. Initialize LLM
def initialize_llm(llm_model):
    print(f"Initializing LLM: {llm_model}")
    llm = OllamaLLM(model=llm_model)
    return llm

# 6. Build the RAG Chain
def build_rag_chain(vector_store, llm):
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}) # Retrieve top 3 relevant chunks

    prompt_template = """
    You are an AI assistant for question-answering over documents.
    Use the following retrieved context to answer the question.
    If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

    Context: {context}
    Question: {question}
    Answer:
    """
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)

    rag_chain = (
        {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
        | prompt
        | llm
        | StrOutputParser()
    )
    print("RAG chain built.")
    return rag_chain

# Main execution flow
def main():
    if not os.path.exists(DATA_PATH):
        os.makedirs(DATA_PATH)
        print(f"Please place your PDF files in the '{DATA_PATH}' directory.")
        return

    documents = load_documents(DATA_PATH)
    if not documents:
        print("No PDF documents found. Please add PDFs to the 'data/' directory.")
        return

    chunks = split_documents(documents)
    vector_store = create_vector_store(chunks, EMBEDDING_MODEL, VECTOR_DB_PATH)
    llm = initialize_llm(LLM_MODEL)
    rag_chain = build_rag_chain(vector_store, llm)

    print("\nAI Agent is ready! You can now ask questions about your PDFs.")
    print("Type 'exit' to quit.")

    while True:
        user_query = input("\nYour question: ")
        if user_query.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Exiting agent. Goodbye!")
            break

        try:
            response = rag_chain.invoke(user_query)
            print(f"\nAgent's Answer: {response}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            print("Please ensure Ollama is running and the models are downloaded.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## How to Run the Examples

### Step 1: Download the Local Models

Open your terminal and pull the models we’ll be using from Ollama’s registry.

We'll use gemma3:4b for the LLM and nomic-embed-text:latest for embeddings.

```sh
ollama pull gemma3:4b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

You can use another combination if you understand it.

### Step 2: Create a Project Folder and Virtual Environment

It’s good practice to isolate your project’s dependencies. Virtual Env will help us isolate it. On your open terminal, type the following commands (one by one, please):

```sh
mkdir reader-agent
cd reader-agent
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries

On your terminal, run the following:

```sh
pip install langchain langchain-community pypdf chromadb
```

### Step 4: Run the Code

Save the code in the .py file `agent.py`.

Make sure the Ollama application is running first, and run the following in your terminal:

```sh
python agent.py
```

You will see the execution of the code.

The application will run in your terminal, and you can type your answer after the text:

```sh
AI Agent is ready! You can now ask questions about your PDFs.
Type 'exit' to quit.

Your question:
```

If you want to stop the agent, just type **"exit"**.

## Example

For this example I used the ebook "Generative AI and LLMs for Dummies" available free by Snowflake. You can download it from [here](https://www.snowflake.com/resource/generative-ai-and-llms-for-dummies/).

The agent will read the PDF files in the `data/` directory, split them into manageable chunks, create embeddings, and store them in a vector database. When I ask a question, it retrieves relevant chunks and generates an answer using the local LLM.

For example, if I ask:

```
Your question: What is the main topic of the book?
```

It will result in an answer like:

```
(venv) ➜  reader-agent git:(main) ✗ python agent.py
Loaded 52 documents.
Split documents into 138 chunks.
Creating embeddings and vector store...
Vector store created and persisted.
Initializing LLM: gemma3:4b
RAG chain built.

AI Agent is ready! You can now ask questions about your PDFs.
Type 'exit' to quit.

Your question: What is the main topic of the book?

Agent's Answer: The main topic of the book is Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides an introductory overview to these technologies and discusses techniques for training, tuning, and deploying machine learning models.
```

This shows how the agent can effectively understand and answer questions based on the content of the PDF documents.
