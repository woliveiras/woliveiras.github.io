You can also show comments on your blog posts using bluesky.

## How it works

Set the `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` in your `src/config.json` file to your bluesky handle (without the `@`).

Then just post a link to your blog post on bluesky and comments will be shown on your blog posts, looking something like this:

<div class="max-w-md rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-base-200 dark:border-base-800 shadow-lg not-prose">
	![showing comments]($assets/posts/comments.png)
</div>

Note that no "add comment" link is shown if there is no post on bluesky linking to your blog post.

Comments are both server-side rendered on build and updated on the client when you navigate to the page 
(so they work without javascript, but might be a bit outdated).

If you post a link to your blog post on bluesky, likes will also be shown (see [likes via bluesky](../likes-via-bluesky)). 
If you don't want to show likes, you can disable them using the `disableLikes` option in your post options.

```yml
disableLikes: true
```
