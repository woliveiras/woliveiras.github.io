Sometimes, the installation dependencies step of our GitHub Actions can take a long time to complete. This occurs because most of our applications today are made with third-party code, which can be the framework we're using, libraries, or something else.

And it's common to have something like this example, where we have the install phase three times.

```yml
jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: npm test
        run: npm t

  linting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: npm lint
        run: npm run lint

  scan:
    name: npm audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - uses: oke-py/npm-audit-action@v2
        with:
          audit_level: moderate
          github_token: ${{ secrets.AUTH_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          create_issues: false
          issue_assignees: oke-py
          issue_labels: vulnerability,test
          dedupe_issues: true
```

To avoid waiting too long for it, we can use the cache action and speed up our pipeline.

We can do it by adding these lines:

```yml
- name: Cache Node.js modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
```

## Breakdown

- `- name: Cache Node.js modules`: This line gives a name to this particular step in the workflow.
  - `uses: actions/cache@v4`: This indicates that the step will use the official GitHub Action called "cache" at version 4. This action is designed to cache dependencies to speed up our workflows.
  - `with:` This keyword introduces the input parameters for the cache action:
    - `path: ~/.npm`: Specifies the directory to be cached. In this case, it's the default location where npm stores downloaded packages (`~/.npm`).
    - `key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('*/*/package-lock.json') }}`: Defines the cache key. The key determines whether a cache hit occurs (i.e., whether the cache can be reused).
      - `${{ runner.os }}` is the operating system of the runner executing the job.
      - `npm-` is just static text within the key.
      - `${{ hashFiles('*/*/package-lock.json') }}` calculates a hash based on the contents of all `package-lock.json` files in the repository. If the `package-lock.json` file hasn't changed, the hash will be the same, and the cache will be hit.
    - `restore-keys: |  ${{ runner.os }}-npm-`: Provides fallback keys in case the primary key doesn't result in a cache hit. In this case, it will try to restore a cache that matches the runner's OS and contains "npm" in the key.

## How it Works

1. Cache Creation:

- When the workflow runs, this step calculates the cache key based on the OS and the hash of the `package-lock.json` file(s). Example of cache key `ubuntu-latest-npm-abc123`.
- It then checks if a cache with that key exists.
- If it doesn't exist, the action caches the `~/.npm` directory with the generated key.

2. Cache Restoration:

- On subsequent workflow runs, the same cache key is calculated.
- The action checks if a cache with that key exists.
- If it does, the action restores the cached `~/.npm` directory, avoiding the need to re-download all the npm packages.
- If the primary key doesn't match, the action tries the restore keys as fallbacks.

## Key Point

The cache key is crucial. By including the hash of the `package-lock.json` file in the key, the cache is only reused if the project's dependencies haven't changed. If the `package-lock.json` file changes (indicating that dependencies have been updated), a new cache key is generated, and a fresh cache is created.

## Final version

The final version of our workflow with the cache option should be something like this:

```yml ins={5,6,7,8,9,10,11,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,46,47,48,49,50,51,52}
jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: npm test
        run: npm t

  linting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: npm lint
        run: npm run lint

  scan:
    name: npm audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - uses: oke-py/npm-audit-action@v2
        with:
          audit_level: moderate
          github_token: ${{ secrets.AUTH_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          create_issues: false
          issue_assignees: oke-py
          issue_labels: vulnerability,test
          dedupe_issues: true
```

## Conclusion

Caching NPM modules in GitHub Actions significantly speeds up our workflows by avoiding redundant downloads of dependencies. Utilizing the `actions/cache@v4` action with a key based on the `package-lock.json` hash ensures that the cache is only used when dependencies remain unchanged. This optimization reduces build times and improves overall pipeline efficiency, leading to faster development cycles.
