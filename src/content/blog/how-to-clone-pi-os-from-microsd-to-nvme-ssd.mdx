Migrating your Raspberry Pi's root filesystem from a microSD card to an NVMe SSD is one of the most significant performance upgrades you can make. It dramatically improves disk I/O, which in turn enhances overall system responsiveness, application load times, and file transfer speeds.

This guide provides a direct, senior-level walkthrough for cloning your existing Pi OS setup to an NVMe drive.

### Prerequisites

*   Raspberry Pi 4 or 5.
*   An NVMe-compatible HAT or adapter.
*   An NVMe SSD installed and recognized by the Pi.

### Step 1: Identify the Source and Target Drives

First, ensure your system is up-to-date and the NVMe drive is visible.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Next, identify the block devices. `mmcblk0` is typically the microSD card, and your NVMe will appear as `nvme0n1`.

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see an output similar to this, clearly distinguishing the source and destination:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
mmcblk0     179:0    0  59.5G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  59.2G  0 part /
nvme0n1     259:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
```

### Step 2: Clone the System with rpi-clone

The `rpi-clone` script is a reliable tool for this task. If you don't have it, clone the repository and copy it to your path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git
cd rpi-clone
sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin/
```

Now, run the clone command, targeting the NVMe disk. The `-f` flag runs it without prompting for a backup of the destination.

```bash
sudo rpi-clone nvme0n1 -f
```

### The "Partition Name" Warning with NVMe Drives

You will likely encounter the following warning:

```
Target disk nvme0n1 ends with a digit so may be a partition.
rpi-clone requires disk names like 'sda' and not partition names like 'sda1'.

Continue anyway?  (yes/no):
```

This occurs because `rpi-clone` employs a simple validation check that flags any device name ending in a digit as a potential partition. While this logic holds for traditional device names like `sda1`, it produces a false positive for NVMe drives.

The standard naming convention for NVMe devices is `nvme<Controller_ID>n<Namespace_ID>`, making `nvme0n1` the identifier for the entire disk, not a partition. Partitions on this disk would be named `nvme0n1p1`, `nvme0n1p2`, and so on.

Since `lsblk` confirmed `nvme0n1` is a `disk`, it is safe to proceed. Type **`yes`** and press Enter.

After confirming, you may also see an `Error: /dev/nvme0n1: unrecognised disk label`. This is also expected for a new or unformatted drive, as it indicates the absence of a valid partition table. `rpi-clone` will create one for you before presenting the final confirmation:

```
** WARNING **          : All destination disk nvme0n1 data will be overwritten!
-----------------------:

Initialize and clone to the destination disk nvme0n1?  (yes/no):
```
This is the final check. If you are certain `nvme0n1` is the correct destination and it contains no critical data, type **`yes`** again to begin the cloning process.

The script may then ask for an optional filesystem label for the new root partition:
```
Optional destination ext type file system label (16 chars max):
```
This is purely for naming and is not critical. You can simply press **Enter** to leave it blank and start the file synchronization process.

### Step 3: Configure the Boot Order

After the clone is complete, you must instruct the Raspberry Pi to boot from the new NVMe drive.

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to **Advanced Options** > **Boot Order** and select **B2 NVMe/USB Boot**.

### Step 4: Finalize and Reboot

Exit `raspi-config`, shut down the system, remove the microSD card, and power it back on. Your Raspberry Pi will now boot from the NVMe SSD.

```bash
sudo shutdown now
```

You can verify that the root filesystem (`/`) is mounted on the NVMe drive by running `lsblk` again. The output should now show `nvme0n1p2` as the root mountpoint.

### Troubleshooting

#### Mount Failure: "Can't lookup blockdev"

During the "Syncing file systems" phase, you might encounter a mount failure:

```
Mounting /dev/nvme0n1p2 on /mnt/clone
mount: /mnt/clone: fsconfig() failed: ... Can't lookup blockdev.
Aborting!
```

This error typically means the kernel has not yet recognized the new partitions that `rpi-clone` just created. You can manually force the kernel to re-read the disk's partition table.

1.  Run `partprobe` targeting your NVMe disk:
    ```bash
    sudo partprobe /dev/nvme0n1
    ```

2.  Re-run the `rpi-clone` command. The script will be able to find the partition and proceed with the file sync.
    ```bash
    sudo rpi-clone nvme0n1 -f
    ```
