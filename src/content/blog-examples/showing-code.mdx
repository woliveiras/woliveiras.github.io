this is some `inline code`

this is some multiline code:

```js {1,2}
const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = "this is a string";

console.log(b);// [!code highlight]

function test() {
	const test = "this is a very long string, that should hopefully wrap onto multiple lines"; // [!code highlight]

	console.log(test);
}
```
