You can show likes on your blog posts using bluesky.

## How it works

Set the `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` in your `src/config.json` file to your bluesky handle (without the `@`).

Then just post a link to your blog post on bluesky and likes will be shown on your blog posts, looking something like this:

<div class="max-w-md rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-base-200 dark:border-base-800 shadow-lg not-prose">
  ![showing likes]($assets/posts/likes.png)
</div>

Note that no like link is shown if there is no post on bluesky linking to your blog post.

Likes are both server-side rendered on build and updated on the client when you navigate to the page
(so they work without javascript, but might be a bit outdated).

If you post a link to your blog post on bluesky, comments will also be shown (see [comments via bluesky](../comments-via-bluesky)).
If you don't want to show comments, you can disable them using the `disableComments` option in your post options.

```yml
disableComments: true
```

See a live example below:
