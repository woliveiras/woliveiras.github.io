        A Developer's Mental Model for AI-Assisted Engineering
      </p>

      <p>
        AI coding tools can write code for you. But <strong
          >writing code was never the bottleneck</strong
        > — making the right decisions, catching bad suggestions before they compound,
        and maintaining quality across a real codebase is. Most developers use these
        tools on autopilot. This series shows you how to use them <em
          >with intention</em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across <strong>17 chapters and 6 modules</strong>, you'll learn a
        repeatable mental model — <strong
          >Plan, Delegate, Review, Correct (PDRC)</strong
        > — and apply it hands-on to every stage of the development cycle: from writing
        your first prompt to shipping a full feature with multi-agent collaboration,
        automated code review, security hooks, and measurable impact.
      </p>

      <h3>What you'll walk away with</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>mental model</strong> for working with AI that prevents the "accept
          all" trap and keeps you in control of quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom agents, instruction files, and skills</strong> tailored
          to your codebase — so the AI knows your conventions before you even type
          a prompt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practical workflows for <strong
            >test generation, code review, debugging, refactoring, and
            documentation</strong
          > — the daily tasks where AI delivers the most measurable value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>MCP integrations and hooks</strong> that extend what the AI can
          access and automate, from external APIs to pre-execution security validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Governance, security, and impact measurement</strong> strategies
          so you can adopt AI tools at team and org level with confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <strong>end-to-end final project</strong> where you run the complete
          PDRC cycle on a real codebase.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Every chapter is hands-on: real repos, real tools, real trade-offs. No
        filler, no hype — just the engineering discipline that makes AI
        assistants actually useful.
      </p>
